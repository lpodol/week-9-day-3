Create a file called writeup.txt to record your answers to the following questions:

In your own words: what is a database?

An architectualized collection of data that makes it easy to organize and access that data.

List some problems with using files instead of a database:

Not broadly accessible if not connected to a server, cannot update as easily, cannot handle large sets of data.

What is a schema (google may confuse you here)?

A schema is the structure of a given database. It's something of a blueprint that standardizes the way the data is collected, grouped, and accessed.

When you are not specifically adding/deleting or querying your database, is it still running?

Yee...es?
